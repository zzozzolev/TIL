### my solution
```sql
WITH user_joined_2021 AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM user_info
    WHERE YEAR(JOINED) = 2021
)

SELECT YEAR(sales_date) AS year, MONTH(sales_date) AS month, COUNT(DISTINCT ui.user_id) AS puchased_users, ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT ui.user_id) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_joined_2021), 1) AS puchased_ratio
FROM user_joined_2021 ui JOIN online_sale os ON ui.user_id = os.user_id
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month
```

### other solution
- 변수 사용.
- 글쓴이는 `SELECT` 안에 `SELECT`를 넣는 scalar subquery 사용시 로우 개수마다 쿼리를 날린다고 했으나
- 다른 글을 찾아보면 scalar subquery의 경우 동일 input에 대해서는 결과값을 캐싱한다고 함. [관련 글](https://kimdubi.github.io/mysql/subquery_tuning/)
```sql
SELECT COUNT(USER_ID) into @user_count FROM USER_INFO WHERE YEAR(JOINED) = 2021;


SELECT YEAR(O.sales_date) AS YEAR,
    MONTH(O.sales_date) AS MONTH, 
    count(O.USER_ID) AS PUCHASED_USERS, 
    ROUND(count(DISTINCT O.USER_ID)/@user_count,1) AS PUCHASED_RATIO
FROM ONLINE_SALE O
INNER JOIN USER_INFO U ON U.USER_ID = O.USER_ID AND YEAR(U.JOINED) = 2021
GROUP BY YEAR(O.sales_date),MONTH(O.sales_date)
ORDER BY YEAR,MONTH
```
