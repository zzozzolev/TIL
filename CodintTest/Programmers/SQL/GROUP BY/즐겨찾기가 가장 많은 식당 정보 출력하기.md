### my solution
```sql
SELECT FOOD_TYPE, REST_ID, REST_NAME, FAVORITES
FROM REST_INFO
GROUP BY FOOD_TYPE
HAVING MAX(FAVORITES)
ORDER BY FOOD_TYPE DESC;
```

### other solution
```sql
SELECT food_type, rest_id, rest_name, favorites
FROM rest_info
WHERE (food_type, favorites) IN (
    SELECT food_type, MAX(favorites)
    FROM rest_info
    GROUP BY food_type
)
group by food_type
ORDER BY food_type DESC;
```

```sql
SELECT FOOD_TYPE, REST_ID, REST_NAME, FAVORITES FROM 
(
SELECT FOOD_TYPE, REST_ID, REST_NAME, FAVORITES,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY FOOD_TYPE ORDER BY FAVORITES DESC) AS RN
FROM REST_INFO) REST_INFO
WHERE RN = 1
ORDER BY FOOD_TYPE DESC
```

### 코멘트
- 통과 못 함
- 이게 왜 GROUP BY 문제인지 모르겠음.
- `ROW_NUMBER`로 푸는 게 더 적합해 보임.
