### my solution
```sql
SELECT AUTHOR_ID, AUTHOR_NAME, CATEGORY, SUM(TOTAL_SALES) AS TOTAL_SALES
FROM (
    SELECT a.AUTHOR_ID, a.AUTHOR_NAME, b.CATEGORY, s.SALES * b.PRICE AS TOTAL_SALES
    FROM BOOK_SALES s JOIN BOOK b ON s.BOOK_ID = b.BOOK_ID
    JOIN AUTHOR a ON b.AUTHOR_ID = a.AUTHOR_ID
    WHERE YEAR(SALES_DATE) = 2022 AND MONTH(SALES_DATE) = 1
) T
GROUP BY AUTHOR_ID, AUTHOR_NAME, CATEGORY
ORDER BY AUTHOR_ID, CATEGORY DESC
```

### other solution
```sql
SELECT AUTHOR.AUTHOR_ID, AUTHOR.AUTHOR_NAME, BOOK.CATEGORY, SUM(BOOK.PRICE * BOOK_SALES.SALES) AS TOTAL_SALES
FROM BOOK_SALES
    JOIN BOOK ON BOOK.BOOK_ID = BOOK_SALES.BOOK_ID
    JOIN AUTHOR ON BOOK.AUTHOR_ID = AUTHOR.AUTHOR_ID
WHERE BOOK_SALES.SALES_DATE LIKE "2022-01%"
GROUP BY AUTHOR.AUTHOR_NAME, BOOK.CATEGORY
ORDER BY AUTHOR.AUTHOR_ID ASC, BOOK.CATEGORY DESC;
```
