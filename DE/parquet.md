- itâ€™s important to note that parquet is often described as a columnar format. However, due to the fact that it stores chunks of columns, a hybrid storage layout is a more precise description.
- A file consists of one or more row groups.

### Row Group
- A row group contains exactly one column chunk per column.
- A single Row Group contains data for all columns for some number of rows.
- The row group is divided into entities that are called "column chunks."

### Column Chunks
- Column chunks contain one or more pages.
